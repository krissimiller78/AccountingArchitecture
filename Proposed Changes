Proposed Changes to Accounting Architecture 
Professor Coyne, 
After reading the paper on Accounting Architecture, I would like to make a change to \SubSubSection{Introduction to Accounting Architecture} which states “Additionally, the course should provide practical experience with the components of the technology section by encouraging students to build a computer, install an operating system, create a virtual machine, administrate and query a database, format a partition, host a website, use MapReduce on unstructured data, manage a private cloud, implement a firewall and set up a local-area network. Not all of these experiences have equal value, but each exposes the students to technological components of most enterprise-grade information systems.” 

In your paper, this coursework is included with undergraduate courses. I feel that coursework this in-depth would be better suited for students pursuing a Master’s degree in this particular concentration of accounting. A student seeking a career in developing accounting software and programs would benefit far more than a student seeking a career in accounting or auditing. There are many accounting professions that would never benefit from being able to build a computer. Although I believe a general knowledge of accounting information systems is important to all that plan to go into the accounting field, a course this in-depth isn't necessary for everyone.

Thank you for your consideration of the above changes to your article.
Sincerely, 
Krissi Miller
